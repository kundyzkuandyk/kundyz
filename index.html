            for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”</p>

          <p class="p">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br>
            program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable

      <p class="bond"> Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly <br>recommended!</p>

      <p class="p"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure
        from
        professionals<br> who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former
        student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and
        staff
        did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile
        team

        could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my <br>developent
        experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple
        <br>offers.
        100% recommend! ”
